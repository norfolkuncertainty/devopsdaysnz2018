## Intro
I was lucky enough to have my work pay for my ticket to devops days. Having not gone to one before I was not quite sure what to expect. The conference was Monday and Tuesday with an evening event on Monday night.

## Outro
Overall I really enjoyed the conference. The calibre of the speakers was very high and I gained a lot of knowledge from scheduled talks, open spaces and hallway conversations. I would definitley reccommend attending if you have not.
